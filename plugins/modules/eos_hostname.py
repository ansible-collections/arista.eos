module: eos_hostname
short_description: Manages hostname resource module
description: This module configures and manages the attribute of  hostname on Arista
  EOS platforms.
version_added: 4.1.0
author: Gomathi Selvi Srinivasan (@GomathiselviS)
notes:
- Tested against Arista EOS 4.24.60M
- This module works with connection C(network_cli). See the L(EOS Platform Options,eos_platform_options).
options:
    config:
      description: A dictionary of hostname options
      type: dict
      suboptions:
        hostname:
          description:
          - The system's hostname
          type: str
    running_config:
      description:
      - This option is used only with state I(parsed).
      - The value of this option should be the output received from the EOS device by
        executing the command B(show running-config | section hostname).
      - The state I(parsed) reads the configuration from C(running_config) option and
        transforms it into Ansible structured data as per the resource module's argspec
        and the value is then returned in the I(parsed) key within the result.
      type: str
    state:
      description:
      - The state the configuration should be left in.
      - The states I(rendered), I(gathered) and I(parsed) does not perform any change
        on the device.
      - The state I(rendered) will transform the configuration in C(config) option to
        platform specific CLI commands which will be returned in the I(rendered) key
        within the result. For state I(rendered) active connection to remote host is
        not required.
      - The states I(merged), I(replaced) and I(overridden) have identical
        behaviour for this module.
      - The state I(gathered) will fetch the running configuration from device and transform
        it into structured data in the format as per the resource module argspec and
        the value is returned in the I(gathered) key within the result.
      - The state I(parsed) reads the configuration from C(running_config) option and
        transforms it into JSON format as per the resource module parameters and the
        value is returned in the I(parsed) key within the result. The value of C(running_config)
        option should be the same format as the output of command
        I(show running-config | section ^hostname) executed on device. For state I(parsed) active
        connection to remote host is not required.

      - merged
      - overridden
